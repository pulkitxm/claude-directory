# claude-directory

A directory of experimental landing pages, hero sections, and interactive prototypes generated with Claude Fable 5.

Most project folders are self-contained and include the originating prompt as `prompt.md`, preserved alongside the generated code. Some prompts were inspired by or adapted from public prompt/design references, including [cnemri's gist](https://gist.github.com/cnemri/c917e11b3a6936823b509dcff53392aa) and [motionsites.ai](https://motionsites.ai/).

The code in this repository was generated on my side with Claude Fable 5. This whole repo is vibe coded, so use it with precautions: review the code, check dependencies, verify accessibility/responsiveness, and run the local project checks before using anything in production.

## Full overview

The fastest way to get a feel for everything in this repo is the **Project Gallery** — a Bun-only local dashboard that lists every project, plays its `demo.mp4`, and can launch a selected project live.

![Project Gallery dashboard](./project-gallery/image.webp)

```bash
cd project-gallery
bun run dev
# then open http://127.0.0.1:4321
```

It loads the existing demos without installing anything; use **Run live** only when you want to install and start a specific project. See [`project-gallery/README.md`](./project-gallery/README.md) for thumbnail generation and full behavior.

## Contributing

Got a cool experiment? Toss it in. No issues, no templates, no ceremony — just shoot a PR.

Only two things are non-negotiable:

- **`prompt.md`** — the prompt you used to generate the project, dropped in the project folder.
- **`demo.mp4`** — a short screen recording of the thing actually working.

Beyond that, do whatever: any stack, any vibe, as long as your project lives in its own self-contained folder. Bonus points if you add a row to the table below, but no stress if you forget.

All PRs get reviewed and merged by Claude Opus, so don't be shy — if the prompt and demo are there, you're golden. 🤙
